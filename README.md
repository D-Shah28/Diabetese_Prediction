**Diabetes Prediction System**
# ðŸ“ŒOverview
This project is a Machine Learning-based Diabetes Prediction System using the PIMA Diabetes dataset. The model is built using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical features.

# ðŸš€ Features

* Loads and preprocesses the PIMA Diabetes dataset.

* Standardizes the data using StandardScaler.

* Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

* Evaluates the model using accuracy scores.

* Visualizes feature importance to understand the impact of each medical feature.

* Provides an interactive predictive system to manually enter patient details and get a prediction.
